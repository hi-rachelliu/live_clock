# In Search of Lost Time @ Uchicago - an Unconventional Clock


## Overview 
Built on p5.js, In Search of Lost Time (aka the UChicago rat race clock) is a live clock with day/month tracking. 

## Concept & Inspiration:

This project is an allusion to Marcel Proust’s In Search of Lost Time, which I think is the perfect way to encapsulate how busy life is and how easily time here seems to be “lost,” for better and for worse. 

The clock emphasizes that intense, exacting need to maximize every second of time available to us. However, to counteract the stress conveyed by the clock, the clock also disappears into a (hopefully) relaxing swirling animation when the user presses the “Get Space”  button — “getting some space” from Uchicago’s stress culture. The rainbow color scheme of the swirling animation emphasizes that while life is really busy, it is also simultaneously enriching, captivating— and yes, really — sometimes even fun.

## Interactions:
The drawAnimation() function appears on the screen when the user toggles the “Get Space/Stop” button, and is replaced by the clock when the button is pressed again.
